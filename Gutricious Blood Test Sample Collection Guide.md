# Gutricious Blood Test Sample Collection Guide

Welcome to your Gutricious blood test! This guide will assist you in collecting and shipping your blood sample efficiently. Follow these steps carefully to ensure accurate results for your health assessment.

### What’s Inside Your Kit

- **Alcohol Wipe:** For cleaning your finger before sample collection.
- **Finger Prick Needle:** For performing the finger prick and collecting the blood sample.
- **Blood Collection Tube with Cap:** To securely store your blood sample.
- **Plaster:** To cover your finger after the prick.
- **Tissue:** For drying and cleaning your hands.
- **RigidSafetyBag:** Protects the sample tube during transit.

### Important Reminders

- **Timing:** Collect your blood sample two hours after consuming your lunch cookies. Ensure you have completed both the breakfast and lunch cookies before proceeding with sample collection.
- **Register Your Shipment:**
  - Scan the kit’s QR code to register your shipment online and enable tracking.
  - Confirm that you have the labelled return box ready for shipping.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation

- **Open the Kit Carefully:** Verify that all items listed above are present.
- **Warm Your Hands:** Wash your hands with warm water or rub them together to increase blood flow.
- **Select a Spot:** Choose the side of your ring or middle finger for the prick, as these areas are optimal for blood collection. Clean the selected area with the alcohol wipe and allow it to air dry.

#### 2. Collecting Your Blood Sample

- **Perform the Finger Prick:**
  - Twist off the cap from the finger prick needle.
  - Hold your hand downward and gently press the needle against the side of your finger until you hear a click.
  - Remove the needle after the click to expose the blood.

- **Collect the Blood:**
  - Keep your hand pointed downward and gently massage from the palm to the fingertip to encourage blood flow.
  - Fill the collection tube to at least halfway; if additional blood is needed, use a new finger prick needle and repeat the process.

- **Secure the Sample:**
  - Close the cap tightly on the blood collection tube to prevent leaks.
  - Apply the plaster to your finger for protection.

#### 3. Packing Your Sample for Shipping

- **Secure the Sample in the RigidSafetyBag:**
  - Place the capped blood collection tube inside the RigidSafetyBag, securing it in the plastic holder.
  - Seal the RigidSafetyBag tightly.

- **Place the RigidSafetyBag in the Return Box:**
  - Insert the sealed RigidSafetyBag into the pre-labelled return box. The return box is already labelled for shipping, so no additional labelling is required.

#### 4. Shipping Your Sample

- **Arrange Drop-off or Collection:**
  - Check the return box for the carrier indicated on the pre-labelled box.
  - Visit the carrier’s website to locate the nearest drop-off location or schedule a pickup, ensuring timely shipping.

If same-day shipping isn’t possible, store your sample in the refrigerator at approximately +4°C and ship it on the next available collection day.
