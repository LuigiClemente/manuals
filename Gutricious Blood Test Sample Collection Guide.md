# Gutricious Blood Test Sample Collection Guide

Welcome to your Gutricious blood test! This guide will help you easily collect and ship your blood sample. Remember, this test should be conducted two hours after consuming your lunch cookies. Let's get started!

### What You Will Need

- **Alcohol Wipe:** To clean your finger.
- **Blue-White Finger Prick Needles:** For collecting the blood sample.
- **Blood Tube with Purple Cap:** To store your blood sample.
- **Plaster:** To cover your finger after the prick.
- **Tissue:** To clean and dry your hands.

### Important Reminders

- **Scan the QR Code:** Before starting, scan the QR code on your test kit to register your shipment. This ensures everything is set up for easy shipping.
- **Timing:** Make sure today is a UPS collection or drop-off day to ensure timely delivery of your sample.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation

- **Gather Your Supplies:** Lay out all the components from your kit.
- **Warm Your Hands:** Wash them with warm water or rub them together to increase blood flow.
- **Select a Spot:** Choose the side of your ring or middle finger for the prick. Clean the area with the alcohol wipe and let it dry.

#### 2. Collecting Your Blood Sample

- **Perform the Finger Prick:**
  - Unscrew the cap from the blue-white needle.
  - Hold your hand downward and gently press the white side of the needle against your finger until you hear a click.
  - Remove the needle after the click.

- **Collect the Blood:**
  - Keep your hand down and gently massage from the palm to the fingertip to encourage blood flow.
  - Fill the tube with at least half the amount of blood. If necessary, use a new needle to get more blood.

- **Secure the Sample:**
  - Close the purple cap tightly on the blood tube.
  - Apply the plaster to your finger.

#### 3. Packing and Shipping

- **Pack Your Sample:**
  - Place the blood tube in the RigidSafetyBag and seal it.
  - Place the sealed bag in the shipping bag for biological substances.

- **Prepare for Shipment:**
  - Seal the shipping bag securely and ship your test material on the same day.
  - If same-day shipping isn’t possible, store the sample in a cool place until it can be shipped on the next UPS collection day.
