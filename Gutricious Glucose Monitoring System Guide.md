# Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your Continuous Glucose Monitoring System! This guide will assist you in setting up and using your glucose monitoring device efficiently. Please follow all instructions carefully to ensure accurate results for your health assessment and to complete your Gutricious test with ease.

### Intended Use

This system is designed for individuals over 18 and for teenagers with parental supervision. It provides continuous glucose monitoring to help track sugar trends and detect patterns of high and low glucose levels, offering valuable insights for personalised health management.

### Whatâ€™s Inside Your Kit

- **Alcohol Wipe:** For cleaning and sterilising the application site.
- **Sensor Applicator:** Contains the sensor and assists with applying it to the skin.
- **Sensor Cover:** Protects the sensor, ensuring it remains securely in place.

### Important Reminders

- **Timing for Cookie Consumption:** Ideally, begin monitoring the night before your test or, at minimum, 60 minutes before consuming the breakfast cookies to ensure accurate tracking.
- **Register Your Device and App Installation:**
  - Use the QR code on the glucose monitor device to install the CGM app on your smartphone. This will allow you to set up your device, register it, and enable glucose tracking through the app.
  - Confirm that your device is fully set up and registered in the CGM app before proceeding with the sensor application.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation

- **Open the Kit Carefully:** Confirm that all items listed above are present.
- **Choose an Application Site:** Select either the back of your upper arm or abdomen:
  - **Upper Arm:** Apply to the back of the arm, avoiding muscles on the outer side.
  - **Abdomen:** Avoid the waistband, stretch marks, or any previous injection sites. Ensure the application point is at least 5 cm away from your navel.
- **Clean the Site:** Use the provided alcohol wipe to clean the selected application area, and allow it to dry completely.

#### 2. Applying the Sensor

- **Prepare the Applicator:**
  - Unscrew the cover from the sensor applicator and set it aside.
- **Apply the Sensor:**
  - Align the opening of the applicator with the skin at the chosen site.
  - Press the applicator lightly against the skin and push the implantation button.
  - Wait a few seconds after the click to ensure the sensor is securely attached.
- **Remove the Applicator:**
  - Carefully pull the applicator away from the skin. The puncture needle will retract automatically, leaving the sensor in place.
- **Secure the Sensor:**
  - Confirm that the sensor is firmly in place on your skin.
  - Replace the cover on the applicator for storage, if applicable.

### Data Collection and Logging

- **Log Meals, Snacks, and Sugary Drinks**: During the 3 to 15 days of continuous monitoring, use the Gutricious app to log each meal, snack, and sugary drink you consume. Detailed logging will provide a clearer view of how your glucose levels respond to different foods and drinks.
  
- **End of Monitoring**: Once you have completed your monitoring period, use the CGM device to generate a report of your glucose data. Save this report and submit it through the Gutricious app.

### Additional Benefits

- **Extended Wear Data:** Wearing the device continuously for a minimum of 3 days provides essential insights into glucose patterns. For a more comprehensive view, wear the device for up to 15 days to support informed health decisions.
- **Comfortable Design:** The small, discreet sensor design provides maximum comfort and minimal disruption to daily activities.
