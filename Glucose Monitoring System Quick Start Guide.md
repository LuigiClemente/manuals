### Device Description

The new generation glucose monitoring device is the smallest in its class, designed to minimize inconvenience and maximize comfort. The sensor includes a small, flexible tip that is inserted just under the skin and can be worn for up to 15 days, allowing for continuous data collection over an extended period.

**Select Insertion Area:**

- **Upper Arm:** The back of your upper arm is recommended, avoiding muscles on the outer side.
