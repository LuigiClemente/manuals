# Gutricious Cookie Consumption Guide

Welcome to your Gutricious cookie consumption guide! This guide will help you consume your test cookies correctly to ensure accurate results. Before starting, please review the microbiome and blood test instructions and ensure UPS availability for shipping your samples. Let’s get started!

### What You Will Need

- **Breakfast Cookies:** To be consumed first thing in the morning after an overnight fast.
- **Lunch Cookies:** To be consumed five hours after the breakfast cookies.

### Important Reminders

- **Timing:** Follow the specified time intervals between consuming the cookies to ensure accurate test results.
- **Consumption:** Each portion of cookies must be eaten within 20 minutes. If they are not consumed within this timeframe, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of your test results.
- **Beverages:** You may only drink water, black coffee, or black tea during the fasting periods. Avoid any beverages containing milk, sugar, or other additives to ensure accurate test results.
- **Preparation:** Review both the microbiome and blood test instructions before consuming the cookies to ensure you have enough time for both tests.
- **UPS Availability:** Make sure today is a UPS collection or drop-off day to ensure timely delivery of your samples.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Breakfast Cookies

- **Timing:**
  - Consume your breakfast cookies first thing in the morning after an overnight fast of at least eight hours.

- **Instructions:**
  - Eat the entire portion of breakfast cookies within 20 minutes.
  - During this period, only drink water, black coffee, or black tea. Avoid adding milk, sugar, or other additives.
  - Begin the five-hour fasting period immediately after consuming the breakfast cookies, continuing to drink only the permitted beverages.

#### 2. Lunch Cookies

- **Timing:**
  - Eat your lunch cookies five hours after finishing the breakfast cookies.

- **Instructions:**
  - Consume the entire portion of lunch cookies within 20 minutes.
  - After eating the lunch cookies, start a two-hour fasting period. Continue to drink only water, black coffee, or black tea, avoiding milk, sugar, or other additives.
  - The lunch cookies contain a pink dye to help track digestion. This is completely safe and aids with the analysis.

#### 3. Post-Cookie Consumption

  - After the two-hour fasting period following the lunch cookies, proceed with the Gutricious blood test.
  - Ensure you also have enough time to collect and ship the microbiome sample.
