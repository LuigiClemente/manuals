### **1. Integrate Zammad with Keycloak via SAML for User Authentication**

Zammad supports SAML-based SSO, allowing users to authenticate through Keycloak. To set this up:

- **Configure Keycloak**:
  - Add Zammad as a client in Keycloak.
  - Set the **Client Protocol** to `saml`.
  - Configure mappers to pass necessary user attributes (e.g., email, first name, last name) to Zammad.

- **Configure Zammad**:
  - Navigate to **Settings > Security > Third-Party Applications > Authentication via SAML**.
  - Enter the Identity Provider (IdP) details from Keycloak, including the SSO target URL and IdP certificate.

For detailed instructions, refer to Zammad's documentation on SAML integration.

### **2. Authenticate Zammad API Requests Using Keycloak**

While SAML facilitates user authentication for web interfaces, API authentication typically requires token-based methods. To authenticate Zammad's API using Keycloak, consider the following approaches:

---

#### **Approach A: Utilize Zammad's Built-in API Token Mechanism**

Zammad provides an API token system for secure API access:

1. **Generate an API Token in Zammad**:
   - Log in to Zammad as an admin.
   - Go to **Settings > API**.
   - Create a new token, assigning it to the appropriate user with necessary permissions.

2. **Use the API Token in Requests**:
   - Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests:
     ```
     Authorization: Token token=your_api_token
     ```

This method is straightforward and leverages Zammad's native capabilities.

#### **Approach B: Implement OAuth2 Authentication via Keycloak**

To use Keycloak-issued tokens for API authentication:

1. **Configure OAuth2 in Zammad**:
   - Zammad doesn't natively support OAuth2 for API authentication.
   - However, you can implement a custom middleware or proxy that validates Keycloak tokens and translates them into Zammad API requests.

2. **Set Up Keycloak for OAuth2**:
   - In Keycloak, configure a client for your application with OAuth2 settings.
   - Ensure the client can issue tokens with the necessary scopes for API access.

3. **Develop Middleware for Token Translation**:
   - Create a service that intercepts API requests, validates the Keycloak token, and uses a corresponding Zammad API token to perform actions on behalf of the user.

This approach requires additional development but allows seamless integration using Keycloak's OAuth2 capabilities.

### **3. Considerations and Best Practices**

- **Security**: Ensure secure storage and transmission of tokens. Use HTTPS to protect data in transit.

- **Token Management**: Regularly rotate and manage tokens to minimize security risks.

- **User Permissions**: Align API access permissions with user roles defined in Keycloak to maintain consistent access control.
